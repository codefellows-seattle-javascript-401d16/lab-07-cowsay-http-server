#README

In this project I made a HTTP server so practice some requests using get and put! Also, had a little fun using cowsay.

In order to use, make sure you have cowsay and httpie insalled onto your computer. In your terminal type node server.js and in another file input '{}' | http get localhost:3000/cowsay?text=your+text to try it out!

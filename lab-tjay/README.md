# Lab 07 - COWSAY - by TJAY

I will finish this. Today.

* Did my setup.

* I began with creating my server.js file - making my server start and run with nothing in it in order to ensure I remember how to get one running and at the same time - give me something to play with. All this work would be useless without it.
